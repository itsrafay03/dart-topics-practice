// In thhis file there is a ArtStudent class which extends Student class, means ArtStudent is now child of student class.
// Same like Java, Dart has Single level inheritance and Mulit-level inheritance. But it does not support multiple inheritance.
// Now as Student is a parent of ArtStudent class so we can access all the fields and methods of Student class from the object of ArtStudent class.
// Similarly if we want to access the datamembers and methods of Studnet class in the scope of ArtStudnet class and try to modify them then it is Overriding, like same in Java.
