// Dynamic Function Execution.
// Dynamic function execution means calling a function at runtime, where the function being called may not be known until 
// the code is already running — and it might be stored in a variable, passed as an argument, or returned from another function.
// It’s when you store a function in a variable or pass it around just like data — and then call it later without hardcoding the function name.
