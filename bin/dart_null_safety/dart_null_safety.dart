// We can not assign nullable variable to a nullsafe variable.

// We can do this by use of Assertion operator '!' with nullable variable.

// Similarly

String? student;
// String name = student;  // Error as nullable variable assign to nullsafe variable.
String name = student!; // Assertion operator.

// Another intresting concept.

// var? x;  // Error
int? z;    // No Error
// Reason:
// The first statement, var? x; gives an error because 'var' cannot be combined with
// a nullable type indicator (?). Dart infers the type automatically when using var,
// so it already decides whether the variable can hold null based on the value assigned.
// Adding ? to var is redundant, and thus causes an error.
// var x; by itself is valid and means x can hold any value, including null (default type dynamic).
// If you want x to be nullable and have a specific type, you need to declare it like this: int? x;, String? x;, etc.

// Summary
// var? is not allowed because var doesnâ€™t combine with the nullable operator (?).
// Type? (like int?) is the correct way to declare a nullable variable with a specific type.

// Another concept is discussed in last few lines of main function. This is the topic of type inference but we can discuss it here.
